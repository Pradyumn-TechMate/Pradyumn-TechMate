**Full-Stack Explorer | 90 Projects in 90 Days Challenge**

### 🖋️ About My Journey
I realized that watching tutorials wasn't making me a better developer, so I decided to take the hard route. I am currently in the middle of a self-imposed **90-day sprint**. My goal is simple: Build one functional project every single day to bridge the gap between "knowing" and "doing."

### 🚀 The 90-Day Sprint (Live Log)
*I manually update this log every night after pushing my daily project.*

- **Day 01:** Successfully revamped my GitHub identity and learned advanced Git workflows. (Jan 13, 2025)
- **Day 02:** [Upcoming] Building a CSS-only responsive portfolio layout without using frameworks.

### 🛠 My Current Toolkit
* **Languages:** Moving from basic HTML/CSS to advanced JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Version Control:** Learning how to manage clean commits and branches on GitHub.
* **Philosophy:** Writing clean, readable code and avoiding the "copy-paste" trap.

**Why TechMate?** Because I believe technology should be a mate that solves real-world problems, not just lines of code.
